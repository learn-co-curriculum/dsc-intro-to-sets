Next, you were introduced to some core set operations such as unions, intersections, and complements. After that, all this information was tied together through the inclusion-exclusion principle and a summative example. You also saw how sets translate into Python. You'll start exploring this in further detail in the next lab!"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.8.5"}, "toc": {"base_numbering": 1, "nav_menu": {}, "number_sections": true, "sideBar": true, "skip_h1_title": false, "title_cell": "Table of Contents", "title_sidebar": "Contents", "toc_cell": false, "toc_position": {}, "toc_section_display": true, "toc_window_display": false}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
